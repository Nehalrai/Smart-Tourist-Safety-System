Proposed Solution: Smart Tourist Safety Monitoring & Incident Response System
1. Detailed Explanation of the Solution:
A mobile + web platform for tourists and authorities.
Tourists can register via a blockchain-based digital ID, linking their itinerary and basic info securely.
Real-time location tracking using GPS and geofencing to monitor movements in sensitive areas.
AI-based anomaly detection to identify unusual behavior, like being stationary in a risky zone or leaving a safe route.
Emergency response dashboard for authorities: shows alerts, location heatmaps, and tourist info.
Multilingual support and simple UI for easy adoption.
2. How it Addresses the Problem:
Real-time Safety: Tourists’ movements are monitored; distress signals trigger immediate alerts.
Rapid Incident Response: Authorities receive automated alerts with location and identity info.
Data Integrity & Privacy: Blockchain ensures secure, tamper-proof digital ID and registration info.
Scalability: Can be adapted across regions and integrated with IoT devices (future expansion).
3. Innovation and Uniqueness:
Combines AI + Blockchain + Geo-fencing for tourist safety — no existing solution integrates all three.
Provides digital ID & itinerary tracking without compromising privacy.
Simulated emergency scenarios in demo to show effectiveness.
Modular architecture allows future integration of IoT wearables for health monitoring and SOS alerts.
Focused on multilingual and accessibility-aware design for diverse tourist populations.
